# circRNA
This repository includes code to create a circos plot and Shiny app for Zucko, D., Hayir, A., Grinde, K., and Boris-Lawrie, K. "*In-silico* analysis predicts circRNA biomarkers of viremic phenotype in HIV-1 infected patients."

Code was written by Abdullgadir Hayir and is based primarily on the [`shinyCircos` R package](https://github.com/YaoLab-Bioinfo/shinyCircos).

You can find the interactive visualization [here](https://kblcircosgraph.shinyapps.io/circos/).
